üí≥ Why Was MT202 COV Introduced?
Prior to 2009, banks used MT202 to move cover funds without including customer info, creating compliance risks:

Authorities (like FinCEN) required visibility into originator and beneficiary

SWIFT created MT202 COV to meet AML/CFT and sanctions compliance regulations
