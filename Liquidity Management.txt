🔁 How Liquidity Management Monitoring Runs (End-to-End Flow)
Here’s a typical real-time or EOD (End-of-Day) cycle:

🕗 1. Data Collection
Bank statements fetched using MT940 (EOD) or MT942 (Intraday)

API calls for real-time balances

ERP updates AP/AR data

Forecasted cash flow inputs (e.g., payroll, vendor payments)

📊 2. Cash Position Calculation
Cash available in all accounts globally

Subtract committed outflows

Add expected inflows

Calculate Net Cash Position

Example:

Available: ₹12 Cr  
Pending Payroll: ₹4 Cr  
Vendor Payments: ₹3 Cr  
Collections expected: ₹5 Cr  
Net Cash: ₹12 + ₹5 - ₹7 = ₹10 Cr surplus


🚨 3. Alerts & Exception Handling
Shortfalls trigger alerts

System may suggest internal fund movements or external borrowing

🔄 4. Sweeping / Pooling
Funds automatically moved to/from concentration account

Notional or physical pooling done by bank as per agreement

✅ 5. Final Actions
Treasury decides to invest surplus (e.g., short-term deposits)

Fund deficits via borrowing or overdrafts

Confirm funding needs with front-office dealers
