üîÑ Sweeping vs Pooling in Cash Management
Both sweeping and pooling are cash concentration techniques used by corporates and banks to optimize liquidity across multiple accounts. They help maximize returns, minimize borrowing, and reduce idle cash.

| **What it is**   | Physically moves funds between accounts                    | Combines account balances notionally (no physical movement) |
| **Type**         | Actual cash movement                                       | Virtual/accounting-based adjustment                         |
| **Process**      | Transfer balances (e.g., debit sub-account, credit master) | Offset debit/credit balances across accounts for interest   |
| **Common Forms** | Zero Balancing, Target Balancing                           | Notional Pooling                                            |
| **Used for**     | Centralizing funds for payments or investments             | Optimizing group interest without affecting local autonomy  |


üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
üß≤ Sweeping (Physical Cash Transfer)
At the end of the day (or intraday), sub-accounts are swept into a master/concentration account.

Reverse sweep (putting funds back) may also occur if needed.

Variants:

Zero Balancing (ZBA): Leaves zero balance in sub-accounts.

Target Balancing: Maintains a target balance (e.g., ‚Çπ10 Lakhs), sweeps excess/deficit.

üßÆ Pooling (Notional Aggregation)
No cash transfer.

Bank calculates interest on the net of balances across accounts.

Usually allowed only when all accounts are with same bank and under same legal ownership.

üåê Real-Time Use Cases
‚úÖ Sweeping Use Case
Company: ABC Retail Ltd (India)
Scenario:

	ABC has 100+ stores across India.
	Each store has its own bank account for daily deposits.
	End of day, all balances are swept into a corporate head office account.
	Treasury uses these funds for investment or supplier payments next morning.

Benefits:

	Central control of liquidity
	No idle cash in branch accounts
	Easier investment of pooled cash

‚úÖ Pooling Use Case
Company: XYZ Global Holdings (HQ in Germany)
Scenario:

	XYZ has multiple entities in UK, Germany, France, and Netherlands.
	Each entity operates independently but keeps accounts in the same bank (e.g., HSBC).
	Instead of sweeping, XYZ uses notional pooling.
	Bank offsets debit in France with surplus in Germany to calculate interest.

Benefits:

	Lower interest expense on overdrawn accounts
	No FX conversion needed
	No intercompany transfers required

‚ö†Ô∏è Regulatory Considerations
	Pooling may not be allowed in countries with strict currency or legal entity controls (e.g., India, China).

	Sweeping is more globally accepted but may trigger tax or FX implications.

‚úÖ So pooling is happened with in the same bank (same country)?
‚úÖ Pooling: Where and How It Works
üè¶ Same Bank ‚Äì Yes (Required)
Pooling always happens within the same bank because:

The bank performs internal balance netting for interest calculation.

No actual fund transfer happens, so the bank needs full control over the accounts.

The bank must provide special pooling agreements and internal ledgering capabilities.

üåç Same Country ‚Äì Not Always Required, but Common
| Scenario                          | Allowed?        | Explanation                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Same Bank, Same Country**       | ‚úÖ Yes           | Most common and simplest form. E.g., all accounts in HSBC India.         |
| **Same Bank, Multiple Countries** | ‚úÖ Yes (Complex) | Possible with **cross-border notional pooling**, subject to regulations. |
| **Different Bank**                | ‚ùå No            | Pooling not possible across banks ‚Äî use **sweeping** instead.            |




‚úÖ Cross-Border Notional Pooling
A liquidity structure where balances from multiple countries, entities, or currencies are notionally aggregated within the same bank group, to optimize interest without physically transferring cash across borders.

No actual movement of funds.

Balances stay in local accounts.

The bank calculates interest based on the net group position.

Requires intercompany guarantees and compliance with local regulations.

‚úÖ Cross-Border Physical Pooling (Sweeping)
A liquidity structure that involves actual cash movements between accounts across different countries or legal entities.

Uses ZBA (Zero Balance Accounts) and target balances.

Often combined with intercompany loans.

Subject to FX conversion, tax, and withholding regulations.

üè¢ Real-World Example
Company: Nestl√©
Bank: Citi or HSBC
Setup:

	Nestl√© has operating entities in Switzerland, France, UK, Singapore.
	Citi offers Cross-Border Notional Pooling service.
	Funds remain in local country accounts, but interest is calculated on the global net position.
	Nestl√© signs cross-guarantee agreements between entities.
	Helps reduce overdraft interest in UK by offsetting surplus in Switzerland.

üìå Regulatory & Legal Considerations
	Cross-border pooling requires:
	Regulatory approvals (especially in China, India, Brazil)
	Cross-guarantees between group entities
	Single bank group handling all accounts
	Consideration for BEPS, transfer pricing, withholding tax




üåç Real-Time Example: Cross-Border Physical Pooling (Sweeping)
üè¢ Company: Procter & Gamble (P&G)
üè¶ Bank: JPMorgan Chase

üìò Scenario:
P&G has multiple subsidiaries operating in different countries, each maintaining their own bank accounts in local currency to manage day-to-day operations:

| Subsidiary Location | Local Currency | Bank Account |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| UK                  | GBP            | JPMorgan UK  |
| Germany             | EUR            | JPMorgan DE  |
| USA (HQ)            | USD            | JPMorgan US  |


üîÑ Objective:
Consolidate global liquidity at the HQ (USA) level to:

Fund payments efficiently

Minimize idle cash

Avoid short-term borrowing

üîÅ How Cross-Border Physical Pooling (Sweeping) Works:
End-of-Day Sweeping:

Local subsidiaries allow the bank to physically transfer surplus funds to the master (header) account in the USA.

JPMorgan executes automated FX conversions where needed.

Reverse Sweeping:

If a local account needs funds, the HQ account sends money back.

This may be treated as an intercompany loan, triggering documentation and tax considerations.

Daily Reporting & Reconciliation:

Treasury receives daily movement logs.

All transactions are recorded in the TMS (e.g., Kyriba, SAP TRM).

üìå Example Flow
Germany Account (EUR): ‚Ç¨2M surplus
UK Account (GBP): ¬£1M surplus
US Header Account (USD): Consolidates both

‚û°Ô∏è EOD Sweep triggers:

	‚Ç¨2M converted to USD and moved to US HQ account
	¬£1M converted to USD and swept to US HQ

üìà Benefits for P&G
	Central visibility of group cash
	Treasury can invest consolidated funds at better rates
	Optimized funding decisions for global payroll or vendor payments
	Reduced overdraft and FX fees in local accounts

‚ö†Ô∏è Compliance Considerations:
	FX conversion charges and risks
	Local regulatory approval (some countries like India, Brazil, China restrict outbound sweeping)
	Withholding taxes and transfer pricing on intercompany loans

üßæ Real-World Policies
	P&G sets sweeping limits per region
	Reverse sweeps require approval workflow in TMS
	FX hedging is done separately to mitigate rate volatility
