**Self-Introduction (for Payment Domain Solution Architect Interview):**

"Hello, my name is Vadivelan, and I have 18 years of experience in software engineering, with a strong focus over the past decade on architecting enterprise-grade applications in the financial and payment domains. I specialize in designing scalable, secure, and cloud-native microservice architectures using Spring Boot, Kubernetes, and event-driven patterns. My recent work includes leading the architecture of payment gateway platforms, collections systems, real-time fraud detection, and integrating with schemes like Visa, Mastercard, SWIFT, and UPI. I have deep knowledge of payment processing lifecycles (acquiring, issuing, clearing & settlement), payment standards (ISO 20022, SWIFT MT), as well as collections processes like Direct Debits, mandate management, sweeping/pooling, and netting. I also focus on observability, fault tolerance, and performance optimization to ensure resilience and regulatory compliance."

		üîÑ Real-Time Use Case: Online Purchase Example
			üéØ Scenario:
			A customer buys a laptop worth ‚Çπ50,000 from an e-commerce site using a credit card.

			‚ñ∂Ô∏è Flow:
				Cardholder enters card details on the e-commerce website.

				Payment Gateway routes the request to the Acquirer (e.g., HDFC Bank ‚Äì Acquirer for Amazon).

				The Acquirer sends the authorization request to the Card Network (e.g., Visa/Mastercard).

				Card Network forwards it to the Issuer (e.g., SBI ‚Äì issuer of the customer's credit card).

				Issuer checks available limit, fraud risk, OTP validation, etc., and responds:

					‚úÖ Approved: Transaction is authorized.

					‚ùå Declined: Due to insufficient funds, fraud suspicion, etc.

				Authorization flows back from Issuer ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Acquirer ‚Üí Merchant.

				The merchant completes the sale and ships the product.

				Settlement occurs later (T+1 or T+2 days):

					Acquirer credits merchant's account.

					Issuer debits cardholder account and transfers funds to the acquirer via card network.
