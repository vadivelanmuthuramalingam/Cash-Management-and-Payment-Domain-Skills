üì¶ SWIFT Block 2 Syntax
Block 2 appears like this:
{2:I103DEUTDEFFXXXXN}

{2:O1031200CITIGB2LAXXX22221234561200N}

There are two types of Block 2, depending on message direction:

üì¶ What is Block 3 in a SWIFT FIN Message?
Block 3 is optional but widely used in production messages.

It contains message-specific, application-specific, or user-defined headers.

Each field in Block 3 is a tagged sub-block in the format:

{tag:value}

üß± Typical Structure of Block 3
Example: {3:{108:ABCREF123456}{113:ROMF}{119:STP}}

Each field provides metadata or processing instructions to either SWIFT or the recipient bank.

üìå What is {108:} Message User Reference?
A user-defined reference set by the sender of the SWIFT message.
Used for internal tracking, reconciliation, and matching of transactions.
Carried end-to-end through the SWIFT network (visible to the receiver).
It must be unique for the institution within a given time frame (typically 90 days).

‚úÖ How a beneficiary bank (bene bank) claims charges in an OUR transaction within the context of an MT103 SWIFT message.
‚úÖ 2. Send an MT191 or MT199 (Request for Payment of Charges)
üì® The beneficiary bank sends a claim message (usually MT191 or MT199) back to the sender bank to claim the fee.

Example:
{1:F01DEUTDEFFAXXX0000000000}
{2:I199CITIGB2LXXXXN}
{4:
:20:CHARGES-REF-001
:21:MT103REF123456
:79:Please reimburse USD 25.00 charges incurred on OUR basis
}


:20: ‚Üí Reference of charge claim
:21: ‚Üí Related MT103 message reference
:79: ‚Üí Free text explanation for reimbursement


‚úÖ 3. Claim via Nostro Account Debit
If there‚Äôs a Nostro/Vostro arrangement:
The beneficiary bank debits the sender bank‚Äôs Nostro account directly for the charges
This is governed by pre-agreed terms in bilateral agreements

| Step | Who              | Action                                                 |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Beneficiary bank | Credits full amount to customer                        |
| 2    | Beneficiary bank | Sends MT191/MT199 to claim OUR charges                 |
| 3    | Sender bank      | Pays charges via separate transfer or Nostro debit     |
| 4    | Both             | Reconcile through internal treasury & settlement teams |




If you (as the sender bank) receive an MT191 from the beneficiary bank claiming OUR charges for an MT103 payment, you need to settle the claimed amount to them ‚Äî typically outside the original MT103.

‚úÖ Option 1: Send an MT103 for the Charges
You initiate a separate MT103 to pay the charge amount back to the beneficiary bank.

Example: MT103 to settle OUR charge
{1:F01CITIGB2LAXXX0000000000}
{2:I103DEUTDEFFXXXXN}
{4:
:20:OURCHARGEREF123
:23B:CRED
:32A:250712USD25,00
:50K:/123456789
Your Bank Name
Your Bank Address
:59:/987654321
Beneficiary Bank Name
Address
:70:Reimbursement for OUR charges ‚Äì MT103 REF: MT103REF123456
:71A:OUR
}


‚úÖ Option 2: Debit their Nostro Account (if pre-agreed)
If the beneficiary bank maintains a Nostro account with you, you can credit their Nostro account internally.

Example: Creadit the amount Bene Bank Nostro account and generate 910 or Mt199 to Bene Bank

You notify them:
Via MT910 (credit advice)

Or MT199 as a free-format confirmation

MT199 Example:
:20:OURCHARGEREF123
:21:MT103REF123456
:79:USD 25.00 debited to your Nostro account as reimbursement for OUR charges


‚úÖ Option 3: Use MT202 for Bank-to-Bank Settlement
Send an MT202 (Interbank Transfer) to route the charge reimbursement if both banks are connected via correspondent banking.



‚úÖ Difference B/w concepts of Ultimate Debtor, Ultimate Creditor, and Initiating Party 

In ISO 20022 (especially in pacs and pain messages), the concepts of Ultimate Debtor, Ultimate Creditor, and Initiating Party help model complex payment chains with greater clarity than legacy MT messages (like MT103).

These fields do not affect the actual payment routing, but they provide transparency in the payment lifecycle ‚Äî especially in scenarios like intermediaries, treasury centers, and payment aggregators.

‚úÖ Example Scenario:
A company "GlobalTech Holdings" initiates a payment via its treasury center "GlobalTech Treasury UK", on behalf of its Indian subsidiary "GlobalTech India Pvt Ltd", to pay an Indian freelancer "Anna Singh" via "PayAggregator India".

| Role                    | Entity                   | ISO Field     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Initiating Party        | GlobalTech Holdings (HQ) | `<InitgPty>`  |
| Debtor                  | GlobalTech Treasury UK   | `<Dbtr>`      |
| Ultimate Debtor         | GlobalTech India Pvt Ltd | `<UltmtDbtr>` |
| Creditor (intermediate) | PayAggregator India      | `<Cdtr>`      |
| Ultimate Creditor       | Anna Singh               | `<UltmtCdtr>` |


‚úÖ Key Differences
| Aspect                 | Initiating Party      | Ultimate Debtor         | Ultimate Creditor        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Who triggers?**      | Initiates the message | Actually owes the money | Actually receives funds  |
| **Regulatory impact?** | Low                   | Medium-High             | High (KYC/AML relevance) |
| **Used for Routing?**  | No                    | No                      | No                       |
| **Visibility for FI?** | Often required        | Strongly recommended    | Strongly recommended     |
